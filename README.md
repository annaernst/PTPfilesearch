# PTPfilesearch

This is a model peer-to-peer system using sockets, where any peer can initiate a file search and retrieve a file from any other peer in the network, if the file exists. Files can be searched by keyword or file name. Each peer keeps a list of its own files, the files themselves, and the network map. 

## How to Use

A peer goes online when the code is launched on a machine. 
Write the name of a file and Enter to search for and attempt to retrive the file.
'q' to quit and disconnect current node from network.
